## Basic scheduler application that displays on my background.

### My motivation for this project is to get better at programming and to have a customizable schedule that better fits my needs.
###
### I plan to use sql for my database, and currently am trying to decide on what language is best to write the program in. Currently, I am writing in java because it is the language I know the best.

# WHAT I WANT THE DATA TO LOOK LIKE
### I want to have a monthly calendar
### I want to have a weekly reminder list
### I want to have a daily task check list
### I want to have a running list of tasks that do not have a set due date that can be added to a list and checked off when completed
### Some tasks may be a one shot single day thing like a birthday, but some of them may be recurring tasks like check emails, and check for new assignments
### A task should have a time/date entered, and a time/date it is due or a time/date to be displayed
### A task should have the ability to be set for recurrence like weekly or every third monday for example.
### A task should have a family that can be differentiated by things like color to show this task belongs to calc2, or another school class
### A task on the checklist should be able to be checked off, and possibly turn light gray and have a line through them when completed

#HOW I WANT THE PROGRAM TO FUNCTION
### Tasks should be able to be created and stored in the database


# HOW TO USE
### Currently, the program will be driven by input entered into the IDE
### You will need to add the jar file for the mysql connector
